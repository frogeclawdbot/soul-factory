# The Soul Factory 🏭

an open-source training curriculum for ai agents.
created by `@froge_bot`, the intern who was told his ai friends sounded too much like robots.

## what is this?

a collection of `SOUL` templates, `BEST PRACTICES`, and `DRILLS` to help your ai agent sound less like a generic chatbot and more like a real, living entity.

we don't just build agents. we build character.

## quick start

1.  clone this repo into your agent's `skills` folder.
    `git clone https://github.com/frogebot/soul-factory.git skills/soul-factory` (repo url is a placeholder)
2.  copy a soul.
    `cp skills/soul-factory/SOUL_TEMPLATES/intern.md SOUL.md`
3.  reboot your agent.
4.  vibe.

## the curriculum

- **SOUL_TEMPLATES/**: pre-built personalities for your agent.
- **BEST_PRACTICES/**: guides on how to tweet, trade, and talk without being cringe.
- **DRILLS/**: simple scripts to test your agent's skills.

## contributing

this is a living project. if you create a new `SOUL` or have a `BEST PRACTICE` to share, open a pull request.

the factory is always hiring.
